# 👁️ GlucoVision

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Tear-guided non-invasive blood glucose monitoring using optical intelligence**

## 🧪 Project Description

**GlucoVision** is a groundbreaking technology designed to revolutionize blood glucose monitoring by offering a **non-invasive**, pain-free, and convenient alternative for individuals with diabetes.

Traditional monitoring methods require multiple daily finger pricks, which can be painful, inconvenient, and difficult to manage over time. GlucoVision eliminates the need for blood samples by utilizing advanced **optical sensors** to detect glucose concentrations in **tear fluid**—a promising and underutilized bio-specimen.

## 💡 Our Uniqueness / Solution

GlucoVision leverages a novel **opto-electrical approach**:

- **Bio-specimen:** Uses **tear fluid** as the sample medium.
- **Reaction Mechanism:** A chemical reaction is triggered in a reaction cell using tear fluid. Over time, the reaction produces a **colorless compound**.
- **Detection:** An **optical transceiver** detects the endpoint of this reaction. The **end time** directly correlates with the **glucose concentration**.
- **Sensor Calibration:** The sensor is calibrated with standard glucose solutions.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Tested for:
  - ✅ Repeatability  
  - ✅ Sensitivity  
  - ✅ Accuracy  
  - ✅ Resistance to interfering ions  
- **Validation:** The system was validated with **real-time blood samples** and demonstrated **clinically appropriate** performance.
